TUTORIAL_0_DESCRIPTION,"Here you can learn the basics of playing Xeno Card.
Sections 1 through 15 cover everything you need to play the game, but there is more if you want a deeper understanding.

Some sections also have playable tutorials to get a better grasp of what they explain.

If you click the “Mark as done” button below this section will get a checkmark. This way you can keep track of what you have already read. Sections also get the checkmark after finishing a playable tutorial.",
TUTORIAL_1_DESCRIPTION,"To win a game of Xenocard, you must have your opponent run out of cards in their deck before you do. Each player starts the game with 40 cards in their deck. The game ends immediately once a player's deck is empty.

A player's deck loses cards when they draw cards, pay the cost of playing cards, or their deck is attacked directly.",
TUTORIAL_2_DESCRIPTION,"Each deck must have exactly 40 cards, and no more than 3 cards of the same name.

You can create decks in the Deck Builder, which you find on the main menu.

There is also a list of preset decks you can use to play or as a base for decks you create.",
TUTORIAL_3_DESCRIPTION,"At the start of the game, each player draws 5 cards from their deck.

When a player has their first turn, they will have the option to do up to 3 mulligans to try to get a better starting hand. Doing a mulligan means to shuffle your hand into your deck and draw 5 new cards.

After your chance to mulligan, your turn starts and you draw another card for your Draw Phase.",
TUTORIAL_4_DESCRIPTION,"There are three main card types, each with their own color.

- Battle Cards: Set to the field to attack the enemy.
- Event Cards: Played from the hand for one-time effects.
- Situation Cards: Set to the field for lasting effects.",
TUTORIAL_5_DESCRIPTION,"The field consists of three areas for each player, each with space for four cards at a time.

The Standby Area
When a battle card is played, it is set to the Standby Area. Cards in the Standby Area do not attack.

The Battlefield
Battle cards are moved from the Standby Area to the Battlefield to attack. Cards that say so in their card text can be played directly to the battlefield.

The Situation Area
When a situation card is played, it it set to the Situation Area. While there, its effects are active.",
TUTORIAL_6_DESCRIPTION,"During a game, each player has three piles of cards.

The Deck
All cards start in the deck. This is where you draw cards from. If your deck becomes empty, you lose the game.

The Lost Pile
Cards are moved from your deck to your lost pile when you pay the cost of a card or your deck is attacked directly.
You cannot see what cards are in your lost pile.

The Junk Pile
Cards are moved to the junk pile when they are discarded or destroyed. Event cards also go to the junk pile after use.
You can see what cards are in your junk pile.",
TUTORIAL_7_DESCRIPTION,"Above the image on a card is the card’s name, type and attribute. For example, Lv 1 KOS-MOS’s attribute is machine.

Below the image is the card’s HP, ATK, attack type, field requirement and cost. These will be explained more later. Only battle cards have HP, ATK and attack types.

At the bottom is the card’s text.
It explains the effects of the card.
There is also its serial number,
rarity and the name of the artist
who made its picture.

During a game, you can right click
cards to inspect them. Then you
can hover over parts of the card
to get explanations.",
TUTORIAL_8_DESCRIPTION,"During each of your Set Phases, you can play one battle card and one situation card. During your Event or Block Phase, you can play any number of event cards.

To play a card, you must first meet its field requirement and pay its cost. Let us use Lv 1 KOS-MOS as an example.

The card’s field requirement is one
human and one battle card of any
attribute. You must have these two
cards on your field to play it.
To pay the cost, move the top 5
cards of your deck to your lost pile.

When a battle or situation card is
played, it gets an E-mark until your
battle phase. Cards with an E-mark
do not count for field requirements.

The playable example is highly
recommended as it guides you
through playing each type of card.",
TUTORIAL_9_DESCRIPTION,"Cards that represent a single character are called character cards. You can only have one card of any single character on your field at a time. For example, you cannot play a Lv 1 Shion if you have a Lv 10 Shion on your field. Some cards, such as AG-02-M have the Unique effect, which limits them to one on the field without being character cards.

Some character cards have a “level up” effect. This allows them to be played even if another card of the same character is on your field. The card on your field is discarded and the new one takes its place. Any damage taken carries over.",
TUTORIAL_10_DESCRIPTION,"Weapon cards are a special type of battle card that cannot be set to the field directly. Instead they are equipped to other battle cards on the field.

When a battle card is equipped with a weapon, its ATK and attack type are replaced by those of the weapon. The battle card also gains whatever effects the weapon has.
Weapons with 0 ATK do not change
the holder’s ATK or attack type.

If you try to equip a weapon to card
that already has one, its current
weapon will be discarded.",
TUTORIAL_11_DESCRIPTION,"Battle cards with the gnosis attribute have a special characteristic. To play them, you must first discard one or more human cards on your field. You cannot discard cards with E-marks to play these cards.

Unlike other battle cards, gnosis can be played directly to the battlefield and they do not get an E-mark. This makes them great for surprise attacks.",
TUTORIAL_12_DESCRIPTION,"Each turn consist of eight phases. In order, they are…

- Draw Phase: You draw a card from your deck.

- Move Phase: Move cards to or from the battlefield.

- Event Phase: Play any number of event cards.

- Set Phase: Play battle and situation cards.

- Block Phase: The enemy can play event cards.

- Battle Phase: Cards on the battlefield attack.

- Adjust Phase: Card effects can activate, and you discard cards if you have more than 6 in your hand.

Then the next player has their turn.",
TUTORIAL_13_DESCRIPTION,"Battle cards have one of four attack types. Its attack type determined what it will hit during the battle phase.

Hand
Can only attack the front row of the enemy's battlefield from the front row of your battlefield.

Ballistic
Attacks the closest enemy in its own battlefield column. If there are no enemies, it attacks the enemy's deck.

Spread
Deals damage to every enemy card on their battlefield at once, but cannot attack the enemy's deck.

Homing
Ignores any enemy cards on the battlefield and attacks the enemy's deck directly.

When a Ballistic or Homing card attacks the enemy’s deck, they move cards from the top of their deck to their lost pile equal to the damage. Get their deck down to 0 cards and win!",
TUTORIAL_14_DESCRIPTION,"During the battle phase, all the cards on the turn player’s battlefield attack in a fixed order based on attack type and position.

The attack order for attack types is:
1. Hand
2. Spread
3. Ballistic
4. Homing

When multiple cards with the same attack type are on the battlefield, their attack order is determined by the numbers on their battlefield zones. That is top left, top right, bottom left then bottom right.",
TUTORIAL_15_DESCRIPTION,"Now you know all the fundamentals of playing Xeno Card.
Here is a quick recap.

You play battle cards to meet the field requirements for strong cards. With these cards, you destroy the enemy’s battle cards so that you can attack their deck directly.

When their deck reaches 0 cards, you win. If your deck reaches 0 cards, you lose.

Use event cards and situation cards to support your battle cards or disrupt the enemy so that you can gain the advantage.

You can now go to Solo Game in the main menu to try your first game. I hope you enjoy!

Feel free to keep reading now or come back later if you want a deeper understanding or need a reminder on anything.",
